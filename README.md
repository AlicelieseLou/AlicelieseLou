- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlicelieseLou. In the real world, I am an undergraduate Informatics Student at Institut Informatika Indonesia Surabaya and Machine Learning Cohort at Bangkit Academy Led by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, & Traveloka 2024 Batch 2.
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Cryptography & Network Security and Game Development With Unity.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a small community first to develop my skills and see how far my skills can be applied in real-world cases. So far, I have created several projects to help Information Systems such as cashier systems, and so on.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I still have difficulties in developing web-based, such as difficulties in implementing JavaScript and Frameworks.
